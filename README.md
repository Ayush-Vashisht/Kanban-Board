# Kanban Board

This project is an interactive Kanban board application developed with React JS. It connects with an API endpoint (https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment) to fetch and display ticket data. The application allows users to group and sort tickets based on specific criteria, offering an efficient way to manage and organize tasks.


## Features

**Dynamic Grouping Options**: Users can group tickets by:

- *Status* - Tickets are organized based on their current status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- *User* - Tickets are categorized by the user they are - assigned to, making it easy to see each user's responsibilities.
- *Priority* - Tickets are grouped by their priority levels, allowing users to focus on high-priority tasks.

**Flexible Sorting Options**: The displayed tickets can be sorted by:

- *Priority* - Tickets are sorted in descending order of priority.
- *Title* - Tickets are arranged in ascending order based on their titles for easy readability.

**Responsive and Engaging Design**: The Kanban board is designed to be visually appealing and adaptive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various screen sizes. The layout is inspired by industry-standard Kanban boards, making it familiar and intuitive to navigate.
